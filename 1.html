<p>I’ve always enjoyed your <strong>class for the <u>past two years.</u></strong>
When I first came to you and told you about my
difficulties in your class, you gave me words of
encouragement I will never forget. I didn’t get an A in
your class, but it was always interesting. I know you’ve
helped so many students<br><img src="다운로드.jpg" width="25%"> <br><br>for the twenty years you’ve
worked at Bayside High. Now I’m sad that Bayside High
is losing one of its greatest teachers. I appreciate all the
effort you’ve put in teaching and wish you a happy retirement.</p>
