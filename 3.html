<p>M: Monica. Have you made plans for your trip to Busan?
W: Yes, Dad. I’m going to the beach and visiting an aquarium in the morning.
Then I’ll eat lunch at a fish market and go hiking.
M: Hold on! That sounds quite demanding.
W: You know, it’s my first trip after starting college.
M: I understand, but I think you shouldn’t plan too many things to do for a trip.
W: Well, I only have one day, and I want to experience as much as possible.
M: You’ll be worn out if you stick to your plan. Also, consider the time it takes
to move to each place.
W: I guess you’re right. And there could be a long waiting line at some places.
M: Right. That’s why you shouldn’t fill your trip plan with too many things.
W: Okay. I’ll revise my plan</p>
