M: Front desk. How may I help you?
W: I’m in Room 201. I specifically booked a non-smoking room, but I smell
cigarette smoke in my room.
M: We’re sorry about that. Let me check that for you. [Typing sound] You’re
Wendy Parker, right?
W: Yes, that’s correct.
M: Hmm, the record says we assigned you a non-smoking room.
W: Then why do I smell cigarette smoke here?
M: Well, since your room is close to the ground level, cigarette smoke must
have come in from outside. Sorry for the inconvenience. Would you like to
switch rooms?
W: Yes, please. The smell is really bothering me.</p>
